# Erst By Hintents

**Erst** is a specialized developer tool for the Stellar network, designed to solve the "black box" debugging experience on Soroban.

> **Status**: Active Development (Pre-Alpha)
> **Focus**: Soroban Error Decoding & Transaction Replay

## Scope & Objective

The primary goal of `erst` is to clarify **why** a Stellar smart contract transaction failed.

Currently, when a Soroban transaction fails on mainnet, developers receive a generic XDR error code. `erst` aims to bridge the gap between this opaque network error and the developer's source code.

**Core Features (Planned):**

1.  **Transaction Replay**: Fetch a failed transaction's envelope and ledger state from an RPC provider.
2.  **Local Simulation**: Re-execute the transaction logically in a local environment.
3.  **Trace decoding**: Map execution steps and failures back to readable instructions or Rust source lines.

## Usage (MVP)

### Debugging a Transaction

Fetches a transaction envelope from the Stellar Public network and prints its XDR size (Simulation pending).

```bash
./erst debug <transaction-hash> --network testnet
```

## Documentation

- **[Architecture Overview](docs/architecture.md)**: Deep dive into how the Go CLI communicates with the Rust simulator, including data flow, IPC mechanisms, and design decisions.
- **[Project Proposal](docs/proposal.md)**: Detailed project proposal and roadmap.
- **[Environment Variables](docs/environment-variables.md)**: Complete reference for all configuration options and environment variables.

## Technical Analysis

### The Challenge

Stellar's `soroban-env-host` executes WASM. When it traps (crashes), the specific reason is often sanitized or lost in the XDR result to keep the ledger size small.

### The Solution Architecture

`erst` operates by:

1.  **Fetching Data**: Using the Stellar RPC to get the `TransactionEnvelope` and `LedgerFootprint` (read/write set) for the block where the tx failed.
2.  **Simulation Environment**: A Rust binary (`erst-sim`) that integrates with `soroban-env-host` to replay transactions.
3.  **Execution**: Feeding the inputs into the VM and capturing `diagnostic_events`.

For a detailed explanation of the architecture, see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## How to Contribute

We are building this open-source to help the entire Stellar community.

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- Rust (for building the simulator binary)
- Stellar CLI (for comparing results)

### Getting Started

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/demo.gif" alt="CLI Demo" width="1000">
</p>

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dotandev/hintents.git
    cd hintents
    ```
2.  Build the Rust simulator:
    ```bash
    cd simulator
    cargo build --release
    cd ..
    ```
3.  Run tests:
    ```bash
    go test ./...
    ```

### Development Roadmap

See [docs/proposal.md](docs/proposal.md) for the detailed proposal.

1.  [ ] **Phase 1**: Research RPC endpoints for fetching historical ledger keys.
2.  [ ] **Phase 2**: Build a basic "Replay Harness" that can execute a loaded WASM file.
3.  [ ] **Phase 3**: Connect the harness to live mainnet data.
