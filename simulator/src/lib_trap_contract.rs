//! Intentionally faulty contract: executes an explicit Wasm trap.
//!
//! The `core::arch::wasm32::unreachable()` intrinsic compiles to a Wasm
//! `unreachable` instruction, which causes the host to trap immediately with
//! a VM-trap error.  This contract is used exclusively by the simulator
//! safety test-suite to verify that the simulator surfaces Wasm traps as
//! structured `HostError` responses rather than panicking.
