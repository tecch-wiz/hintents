//! Intentionally faulty contract: triggers CPU budget exhaustion via an
//! endless loop.

//! The Soroban host meters every Wasm instruction.  A non-terminating loop
//! will consume all available CPU instructions and cause the host to trap
//! with a budget-exceeded error.  This contract is used exclusively by the
//! simulator safety test-suite.
